## Oplab challenge

### Intro

Hi! If you wanna work with us, you gotta solve this first. Let's see what you've got!

### Instructions

1. This test should be forked, worked on, and then commited to Github, with every comment in **english**.
2. Every applicant should solve **all** the general questions.
3. An applicant must solve frontend questions if applying for a frontend position.
4. An applicant must solve backend questions if applying for a backend position.
5. Solving both, is a bonus :)
6. When you finish this test, send an e-mail containing the repository link and the salary expectations to <hungryforthisjob@oplab.com.br>
7. This test's instructions should be enough.
8. Happy Coding!

### General
Using your favorite programming language:

1. Implement bubble sort.
- bubblesort.zip

2. Implement a linked list.
- linkedlist.zip

3. Implement this [algorithm](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/game-of-stones-1)(üí°Ô∏èthere is no need to signup to this website. Just commit the _gameOfStones_ function implementation and that's it.üí°Ô∏è).
- stones.zip

4. Using the twitter API, create a script that given a word as an input, outputs the last 10 tweets containing that word.
- tweeter.zip

This script uses tweepy and dotenv libraries
- python -m pip install tweepy
- python -m pip install python-dotenv

The script expects an argument in command line, the keyword/phrase to search. The 10 tweets found are stored in a file called result.
- Example: python searchTwitter "Big Brother Brasil"

### Frontend

_We will be evaluating everything, from reproduction accuracy, to process. If you use ( with mastery ) tools/frameworks such as `gulp`, `react`, `angular`, `webpack`, etc..; we will take that in consideration. Also: we care about beautiful code (~~var~~) üëæ_

Reproduce, faithfully, this [page]( http://ydirection.com/Aria/index-3.html ).

- frontend_public.zip

### Backend

_I know, I know... It looks easy compared to the frontend challenge; but don't be fooled! We expect **more** from your answers in here! We will evaluate **how** you answer, and your answer's organization and structure!_

Answer the following questions:
- Suppose you're working with 3 people on a project. What would be **the** ideal software development process?

_IMHO, one of the most applicable software development process with a small or tiny team is the SCRUM, although I don't have much experience with it but I know its a project management framework that focus on agile development._

- How do you think an entity relationship diagram for _Instagram_ would be like?

_Please verify er-diagram.pdf file_

- Now that you have imagined the ER diagram, **how** would you build _Instagram_ from scratch?

_In many organizations it's a common practice to start a software development project using the ER model/diagram structure and specification as a starting point. I think a software development proccess is, and need, more than a ER model, it's only a small piece of the entire system specification._

_Despite of the tools, frameworks and methodologies available today for a rapid software development, a software development proccess is a project and as a project it stands for a planning, analysis before coding/installation. A team is necessary to make a plan and brainstorm about requirements (in example: deadlines, financial, specifications, technology), limitations and risks, after planning and analysis phase the team should be able to start the project specifications, here we have tools like models and diagrams to document the project completely as possible. In this point, the project must be known by entire team, shall would be decided some technical specs like databases, programming language, platforms and other technologies stuff. After that, I think it's possible to use (or merge) some agile methodologies like SCRUM to distribute team tasks, make meeting regularly, define goals and deadlines and so on._

_Like I said, I don't have much more experience on agile methodologies but I believe it's a starting point and making some adjustments as needed._

That's it! Thanks for doing this test!
